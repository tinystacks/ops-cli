# Introduction

Ops Console is an open-source developer portal that delivers a dashboard with an inline CLI notebook so that application teams can more reliably and efficiently manage cloud infrastructure. With a low-code, widget-based approach, developers can design custom dashboards and workflows on a project basis and even build their own custom widgets.

The platform comes with default plugins that offer a variety of features such as widgets for AWS ECS services and deployments, IAM JSON Policy viewers, and an AWS CLI, among others. The widgets are interactive and can exchange information, which enables the creation of dynamic and robust dashboards. With a provider and plugin model, developers can customize and extend the Ops Console as much as they wish. The samples/ folder includes several samples of dashboards that can be configured via YAML. 

# Use Cases
The OpsConsole is a personalized portal that can be used for many cloud developer workflows. 
<br/><br/>Some of the use cases we've considered are:

‚úÖ  Building deep operational health dashboards<br/> 
‚úÖ  Easily navigating through cloud resources for your application<br/>
‚úÖ  Sharing and running operational scripts via the CLI plugin<br/> 
‚úÖ  Managing cloud sprawl and automating resolution for underutilized resources<br/>

# üìç Roadmap
- [x] CLI widget to save and run scripts
- [x] Executable actions within widgets (ex. kill task for AWS ECS)
- [ ] `ops-cli deploy` for a hosted dashboard
- [ ] Additional provider integrations (GitHub, Google Cloud, Azure, Snowflake, Cloudflare)
- [ ] Edit ECS Environment variables
- [ ] CI/CD widget
- [ ] Cost control: underutilized resources widget
- [ ] Granular permissions

# Getting started
Follow installation instructions below to get the CLI installed. For a very basic dashboard that contains all the default layout elements, simply run

### Installation
```bash
# Install CLI
npm i -g @tinystacks/ops-cli;

# Make sure you have Docker installed and ports 3000 and 8000 open.
```
### Run sample dashboard 
#### AWS

This package includes other sample dashboard as well. As an example, it includes a sample dashboard that has ECS and AWS account info. To use that, follow these steps:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tinystacks/ops-cli/main/samples/ecs-dashboard-sample.yml -o ecs-dashboard-sample.yml

# Modify line 6 by changing [your AWS profile] to your local AWS profile name
# Modify lines [22-24] by changing the region, ecs clustername, and ecs service names to match resources in your account

ops-cli up -c ecs-dashboard-sample.yml
```
#### Basic
```
ops-cli init;
ops-cli up;
```
# Installation

## Pre-requisites
To use the default installation, you need to have [docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

**Windows users** must have Docker Desktop running.

Also please make sure that ports 8000 and 3000 are open, as those ports are used by the [API](https://github.com/tinystacks/ops-api) and [frontend](https://github.com/tinystacks/ops-frontend). If these ports are reserved, you can pull down the docker images for each of these packages and change the docker run to map ports separately.

## Install from the Global NPM registry
```bash
# Install from the public npm registry
npm i -g @tinystacks/ops-cli;

# Use the CLI, refer to the usage guide below
ops-cli -v;

```

## Local Installation
```bash
# Clone this package
git clone https://github.com/tinystacks/ops-cli.git;

# Install dependencies and build
npm i; npm run build;

# Install the CLI globally
# Using the -g option installs the ops cli to your shell scope instead of the package scope. 
#  It adds the CLI command to bin, allowing you to call ops-cli from anywhere
npm i -g;

# Use the CLI, refer to the usage guide below
ops-cli -v;
```

# Usage

## CLI Commands
### ops-cli
Shows usage and help information

### ops-cli init
Creates a sample config file that includes a basic template. If you don't 

### ops-cli up
Starts the ops console by pulling down the docker images for the ops api (public.ecr.aws/tinystacks/ops-api) and frontend (public.ecr.aws/tinystacks/ops-frontend) and rebuilding them using dependencies included in your yaml file. This may take several minutes depending on your system's available resources. It creates a docker networking bridge called ops-console through which the containers communicate with each other.

#### Options
|Flag|Arguments|Description|
|----|---------|-----------|
|-a, --arch|\<arch\>|  Specifies the architecture. Defaults to 'x86'. Options: 'x86', 'arm'
|-c, --config-file|\<config-file\>|  Specifies a config file. See the `samples` folder in this repo for sample config files.
|-V, --verbose||  Displays additional logs
|-h, --help||             display help for this command

## Sample dashboards
Sample dashboard configurations can be found in the `/samples` folder in this repository. 

## Concepts
|Name|Description|
|---------|---------|
|Console|A console is a top level construct. It includes a name to identify itself, as well as dashboards, widgets, providers and dependencies. 
|Dashboard|A dashboard is a page that consists of an id, a route and list of widget references. 
|Widget|Widgets are components that have two functions: render and getData. getData is called in the API‚Äôs server and is used to make external requests, do computations, etc. Once it is called, it sets some data on the widget itself that‚Äôs passed back to the frontend, where render is called to display the widget.
|Providers|Providers are the beating hearts of the Console. They can be long running and run in the background. They may be passed to widgets to provide sensitive information or long-lived information, whereas widgets are better written as quick request/response styled objects. 

### Providers
Currently supports AWS with plans to add others! AWS provider can be configured with local profiles or Access/Secret keys.  
#### AWS
```
providers:
  AwsLocalProvider:
    id: AwsLocalProvider
    type: AwsCredentialsProvider
    credentials:
      # Option A: local credentials
      profileName: default 
      # Option B: Access/Secret keys (required when deploying with ops-cli deploy)
      # AwsAccessKeyId:
      # AwsSecretAccessKey: 
```

### [Core widgets](https://github.com/tinystacks/ops-core-widgets)
|Name|Description|
|---------|---------|

### [AWS widgets](https://github.com/tinystacks/ops-aws-core-plugins)
|Name|Description|
|---------|---------|
|[CloudWatch Logs](https://github.com/tinystacks/ops-aws-core-plugins#cloudwatch-logs)|Renders a widget containing logs from a CloudWatchLogs log group or log stream.
|[CloudWatch Graph](https://github.com/tinystacks/ops-aws-core-widgets#cloudwatch-metric-graph)|Renders a widget containing graphs populated by one or many CloudWatch metrics.

## Build and customizing dashboards
### Using widgets
1. Define the widget in the `widgets` section of YAML
2. Reference the widget in a dashboard
3. Add the widget's source to the `dependencies` section of the YAML in the format `widget name: 'dependency package'`

### Using providers
Providers provide data to widgets from an external provider.
1. Define the provider in the `providers` section
2. Reference the provider as a list item in widget.

### Sharing data between widgets
Any property in a widget‚Äôs YAML can be substituted for either the props or data of another widget. 
|Parameter|Required|Syntax|Example
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Reference|Yes|$ref: [widget path]|$ref: '#/Console/widgets/EcsInfo'
|Path|No|path: [path of data or props of the widget]|path: region
